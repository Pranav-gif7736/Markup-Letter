  <h2>Exotic dance moves</h2>

  <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question, my favourite is the <cite>Flamingo Lingo</cite>. I'm sure you will agree that it is a very <strong>beautiful</strong> dance form.</p>

  <p>You can see a video of it being performed here: <a href="http://example.com" title="Flamingo Lingo dance video">Flamingo Lingo performance</a>.</p>

  <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
